\section*{Characters}
Each character card is composed of a character number, a character portrait, and a character ability that can be used once per game.

Character abilities on lower-numbered character cards resolve earlier in the round than those on higher-numbered character cards.

The highest-numbered character will be the captain at the beginning of the game.
