\section*{Overview}
Articles of Agreement is a negotiation game for four to seven players that can be played in about thirty minutes.

You will play as the members of a pirate crew who are dividing some loot that you recently ... acquired.
In principle, you are all entitled to an equal share of that loot.
In practice, however, you can split the loot however you want \textendash{} provided that you can convince a majority of the crew to agree to the proposed allocation. 

%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%\item Can you convince your crewmates to give you more than your fair share of the loot?
%\item Will you do the same for any of them in return?
%\item What will you do if your so-called friends decide to cheat you and keep all the loot for themselves?
%\end{itemize}

If you can secure the most valuable share of the loot, you will win the game and become one of history's most infamous pirates.
